        <h2>How I was lead into the coding/tech industry:</h2>
        <p>
            I am always interested in learning new skills and subjects especially in areas of technology. 
            I enjoy how the tech world is interconnected and always pushing the boundaries of what we can accomplish. 
            The atmosphere of growth, innovation, and sense of community really got me interested in program development and in the tech industry in general. 
            It is important to me to be able to be organized in what I do and to utilize my ability to methodically solve whatever problems that I experience. 
            Currently, I am training in program development, specifically in the programing language of C#/.NET Framework. 
            I consider communication one of the most important skills to be able to accomplish personal team goals.
